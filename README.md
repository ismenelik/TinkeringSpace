# Mission
We are creating a community workspace open to all and equipped with state-of-the-art tools and materials to support creativity and collaboration.

With the addition of this laboratory space, the library can support learning, inspire creativity, and nurture opportunities for the next entrepreneur, inventor or artist to emerge in our community.
