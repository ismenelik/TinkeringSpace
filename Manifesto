Make
Making is fundamental to what it means to be human. We must make, create, and express ourselves to feel whole. There is something unique about making physical things. These things are like little pieces of us and seem to embody portions of our souls.

Share
Sharing what you have made and what you know about making with others is the method by which a maker’s feeling of wholeness is achieved. You cannot make and not share. The Library is sharing all of this wonderful equipment with the purpose of fostering a learning and sharing community where anyone is welcome – no matter their skill level.

Give
There are few things more selfless and satisfying than giving away something you have made. The act of making puts a small piece of you in the object. Giving that to someone else is like giving someone a small piece of you. Such things are often the most cherished items we possess.
